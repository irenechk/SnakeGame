# Snake Game 🐍 — Scratch Edition

A classic Snake-style game built using Scratch.

## 🎮 About  
In this game, you control a snake using the arrow keys. The snake moves continuously, and the objective is to collect food (or “apples”) that appear at random positions. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer — but the challenge also increases: avoid colliding with the walls or the snake’s own body. The game ends when a collision happens.  

## ✅ Features  
- Arrow-key controls (up, down, left, right) for smooth movement.  
- Food spawning at random positions to collect.  
- Growing snake length with each food eaten.  
- Score tracking based on how many food items eaten (or length).  
- Collision detection — game ends if snake hits walls or itself.  
- Simple and clean game mechanics, ideal for beginners learning game logic and programming fundamentals.  

## 📺 Play / Demo  
You can play the game directly on Scratch:

> **Note:** This repository does not modify the original game — it only documents or mirrors the project for version control/history.

## 🛠️ How to Run / Use  
Since the game is built with Scratch, no installation or build is required. Just open the Scratch link, and press the green **“Start / Green-Flag”** button to begin playing.  

## 🧑‍💻 Purpose & Learning Outcomes  
This project serves as a beginner-friendly demonstration of:  
- Basic game logic (movement, growth, collision detection)  
- Randomization (food spawning at random positions)  
- User input handling (keyboard controls)  
- Simple game state management (score, game over)  

It’s a great way to learn programming fundamentals and understand how interactive games work — without needing complex coding.
